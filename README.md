LFVdiagrams
===========

These are some Feynman diagrams which may be usefull when discussing
charged lepton flavour violating processes, e.g. τ→μμμ. To allow users to
modifiy them or extend them, the code is provided and users are invited to
extend it.

License
-------

The diagrams are partially self drawn, following the [feynmf/feynmp][feynmf]
documentation, partially they are modified versions of diagrams provided within
the [Feynman Diagram Library][fdl]. To comply with their license the resulting
diagrams are released under the
[Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0][ccbysa30] license.

The source code that is used to generate the diagram files is licensed under
the [GNU General Public License, version 2][gpl2].

Usage
-----

The compilation requires make, python and a current version of pdflatex with
the feynmp and hepnicenames packages. The diagrams are generated by executing

    make

The resulting diagrams can be found in the `pdf_files` folder.
