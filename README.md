LFVdiagrams
===========

These are some Feynman diagrams which may be usefull when discussing
charged lepton flavour violating processes, e.g. τ→μμμ. To allow users to
modifiy them or extend them, the code is provided and users are invited to
extend it.

For simplicity, the resulting diagrams can be found on github, following the
instructions synchronising [Github Pages][gh-pages].

License
-------

The diagrams are partially self drawn, following the [feynmf/feynmp][feynmf]
documentation, partially they are modified versions of diagrams provided within
the [Feynman Diagram Library][fdl]. To comply with their license the resulting
diagrams are released under the
[Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0][ccbysa30] license.

The source code that is used to generate the diagram files is licensed under
the [GNU General Public License, version 2][gpl2].

Usage
-----

The compilation requires make, python and a current version of pdflatex with
the feynmp and hepnicenames packages. The diagrams are generated by executing

    make

The resulting diagrams can be found in the `gh-pages/pdf_files` folder as pdf
files or `white_png_files` and `png_files` as png files with transparent or
white background respectively.

Updating the gh-pages
---------------------

To keep the resulting gh-pages up to date, check out the gh-pages prior to the
compilation of the diagrams.

    rm -r gh-pages
    git clone -b gh-pages git@github.com:<username>/LFVdiagrams.git gh-pages
    make
    cd gh-pages
    python gen_overview.py
    git add pdf_files/*.pdf png_files/*.png white_png_files/*.png LFVdiagrams.zip LFVdiagrams.tar.gz outputs.html
    git commit -m "updated output files"
    git push origin gh-pages
