LFVdiagrams
===========

These are some Feynman diagrams which may be usefull when discussing the
charged lepton flavour violating process τ→μμμ. To allow users to modifiy them
or extend them, the code is provided and users are invited to describe e.g.
µ→eee.

origin
======

The diagrams are partially self drawn, following the feynmp/feynmf
documentation, partially they are modified versions of diagrams provided within
FDL (see LICENSE.md).

TODO
====

 - The build process takes place in /tmp/ which should better be an mktemp -d
   directory.

 - An annoyance is that the fmffile name, specified within the tex file, has to
   coincide with the tex filename.
